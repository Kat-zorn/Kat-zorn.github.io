# About me

As you can see by the beauty that this website is, _I am not a frontend dev_.

## The website

I only know enough JS and HTML to make this website ‘work’. I have created this website to share my experiences on several programming projects. All my blogs are written as Markdown files. I might add in a system to automatically render the markdown, but until then, you'll be stuck reading the source code.

## Education

I am pursuing a double-bachelor Computer Science & Engineering and Applied Mathematics in the Netherlands.

## Experience

I have been programming hobby projects for 4 years now, and I would like to say that I'm pretty good at it. I am most proficient in C++ and Rust, but I know my way around Python too, and I can probably fill the alphabet with languages that I am able to write a Hello World and an If-Else in.
